I've organized all the plots in a dropbox folder: https://tinyurl.com/hj-angles
The files are named in following way:

fits_ are cosθ histograms with fitted functions (chi2 fits are binned, likelihood fits are unbinned);
pars_ are plots of fitted parameters as functions of hj_mass;
llr_ (standing for log of likelihood ratio) are p-value plots (computed from LLR using Wilks’ theorem, i.e. by taking integral of χ² distribution (with 1 degree of freedom, since there's only 1 fixed parameter between the two hypotheses) from LLR to ∞);

_full_ are fits done with will statistics
_unw_ are fits done with the unweighted sample

_9 and _5 correspond to two cosθ intervals that I tried: [-0.9,0.9] and [-0.5,0.5];
_3 and _4 correspond to fits with and without φ2 fixed to zero (numbers stand for the number of free parameters)
